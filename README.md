# pip install PyQRCode

The pyqrcode module is a QR code generator that is simple to use and written in pure python. The module can automates most of the building process for creating QR codes. Most codes can be created using only two lines of code!

QR codes can be saved as SVG, PNG (by using the pypng module), and plain text. They can also be displayed directly in most Linux terminal emulators. PIL is not used to render the image files.
